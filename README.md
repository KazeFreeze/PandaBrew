PandaBrew is a desktop application built with Python and `ttkbootstrap` that provides an intuitive interface for browsing a project directory, selecting specific files and folders, and consolidating their structure and content into a single output file. It's designed to be fast, user-friendly, and visually appealing, with a modern dark theme and a tabbed interface to manage multiple projects at once.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Natively supports **Windows** and **Fedora Linux**.
- **Modern Tabbed GUI**: Manage multiple project extractions in separate tabs, each with its own configuration.
- **Flexible File Selection**: A classic-style file tree allows you to check files and folders for processing.
- **Include/Exclude Modes**: Choose to either package _only_ the checked items or package _everything except_ the checked items.
- **Persistent Sessions**: The app remembers your open tabs, file selections, and window settings between sessions.
- **Responsive UI**: File processing is handled in a separate thread, so the UI never freezes, even with large projects.
- **Real-time Progress**: A progress bar and status label keep you updated on the extraction process.
- **Content Control**: Option to extract only the project structure and filenames without the file contents.
- **Automated Builds**: GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds and releases executables for Windows and Fedora when you push a new version tag.

## üöÄ Getting Started

You can either download the latest executable for your operating system from the [Releases page](https://github.com/KazeFreeze/PandaBrew/releases) or run it from the source.

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- For Fedora/Linux: `sudo dnf install -y python3-tkinter`

### Installation from Source

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/KazeFreeze/PandaBrew.git](https://github.com/KazeFreeze/PandaBrew.git)
    cd PandaBrew
    ```
2.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Run the application:**
    - On Windows:
      ```sh
      python main.py
      ```
    - On Linux:
      ```sh
      python3 main.py
      ```
2.  **Select Source**: In a tab, click `Browse` to choose the root directory of the project you want to extract.
3.  **Select Files**: Use the checkboxes in the tree view to select the files and folders you want to process.
4.  **Choose Mode**:
    - `Include checked`: Only the items you've checked will be in the output.
    - `Exclude checked`: All items will be in the output _except_ for the ones you've checked.
5.  **Set Output File**: Click `Save As` to specify where the final `.txt` report will be saved.
6.  **Extract**: Click the `Extract Code` button to begin the process. You can cancel at any time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building from Source

This project uses `PyInstaller` to create single-file executables. An automated build process is configured in `.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml` to create executables for both Windows and Fedora Linux.

To build the executable manually, first install PyInstaller (`pip install pyinstaller`), then run the appropriate build command.

- **For Windows:**
  ```sh
  pyinstaller --name "PandaBrew" --onefile --windowed --icon "pandabrew.ico" main.py
  ```
- **For Linux (from the project root):**
  ```sh
  pyinstaller --name "PandaBrew" --onefile --windowed --icon "pandabrew.ico" --hidden-import=PIL._tkinter_finder main.py
  ```

The final executable will be located in the `dist` folder.
