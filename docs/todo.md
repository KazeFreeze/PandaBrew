# TODO

- [ ] project type content aware for automatic exclude patterns
      already opened directory
- [ ] fix tab scrolling to always show keybinds and branding
      checked
- [ ] add option to extract dir structure only even in include mode
      but take note of redundant and conflicting settings
- [ ] fix reload should also resync all UIs
- [ ] fix scrolling: when reaching the bottom, the cursor should no longer be
      kept centered
- [ ] fix! even if show excluded, show context are off, it should still show
      the path from root to the file
- [ ] fix: only selected files and not folders should have their siblings shown.
      so if folder only on the same level, it should not show others unless there
      is a sibling file that is actually included - rename to show siblings
- [ ] add capability to rename tabs
