# TODO

- [ ] project type content aware for automatic exclude patterns
      already opened directory
- [ ] fix tab scrolling to always show keybinds and branding
      checked
- [ ] add option to extract dir structure only even in include mode
      but take note of redundant and conflicting settings
- [ ] feat: persist view and selection in session
- [ ] fix: using pandabrew should just open pandabrew and not add
      current folder to session
